# About this Azure DevOps extension

Unity Build is an extension that adds a Unity build task to be used in Azure Pipelines to build Unity projects and configure CI.

## Supported Target Platforms

- PC & Mac Standalone
- iOS
- tvOS
- Android
- Universal Windows Platform
- WebGL

## Test Builds

While each and every project has its own complexity and requirements, these test builds indicate whether the task is successfully building a sample Unity project targeting the configured platform. These pipelines always use the latest publicly available Unity editor version (that is not a beta or alpha version).

## How to use

### Supported Agents

**Hosted Agents**
Hosted agents are supported by the extension. But keep in mind that there might not be the Unity version installed
your project requires. You can find more information about pre-installed software on Microsoft hosted agents [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=vsts).

**Custom Agents**
We recommend hosting your own build agent for Unity pipelines, which is an easy one-time configuration. This gives you full control over installed Unity versions. You can find more information about hosting your own agent [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/pipelines/agents/agents?view=vsts).

### Requirements

- The Unity version to be used for the build needs to be installed on the agent machine
- When building e.g. for UWP, Visual Studio 2017 must be installed on the agent machine. When targeting iOS, you'll need Xcode to be installed etc.

Please refer to the official Unity docs on required software to successfully build for your target platform.

### Install published extension

The extension is published at the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DinomiteStudios.64e90d50-a9c0-11e8-a356-d3eab7857116) and can be installed from there. This is the most straightforward way to get started.

### Custom installation

You can build the extensio yourself and upload it to your Azure DevOps organization. please make sure [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on your development
machine. Also you'll need the [Node CLI for Azure DevOps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tfx-cli) as well as [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript).

1. Download or clone the source
2. Run `tsc unity-build.ts --lib es6` to compile to JavaScript code
3. Run `tfx build tasks upload --task-path unity-build-task/UnityBuildTask` to upload the task to your orgnaization

**Note**
You can not upload the same version number twice. If oyu made changed to the code
and need to upload a new version by changing the version value in the `task.json` file. You can alternatively uninstall the extension before uploading again to avoid this using `tfx build tasks delete --task-id 64e90d50-a9c0-11e8-a356-d3eab7857116`.
